    <h1>Phase Wave Extension</h1>
    <p>World War II (1939–1945) was one of the most significant and destructive conflicts in human history, reshaping global politics, economies, and societies in its aftermath. It involved most of the world’s nations, including all of the great powers, organized into two opposing military alliances: the Allies (primarily the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom) and the Axis (led by Germany, Italy, and Japan). The war began on September 1, 1939, when Nazi Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. This act prompted Britain and France to declare war on Germany, marking the start of widespread hostilities in Europe. Germany's expansionist ambitions, alongside Italy's aggressive campaigns in Africa and Japan's imperial pursuits in Asia, fueled the conflict, which soon spread across the globe.
        A significant cause of World War II was the Treaty of Versailles, which had concluded World War I but left Germany politically and economically destabilized. The treaty's punitive measures fostered resentment, allowing Hitler and the Nazi Party to gain support by promising to restore Germany's power and prestige. Hitler’s ideology of racial purity and Lebensraum ("living space") for Germans justified his invasions and brutal occupation policies. As Germany rapidly advanced, conquering much of Europe, the Axis expanded its influence. Japan, seeking control of the Asia-Pacific, invaded China in 1937 and later attacked the United States' Pearl Harbor naval base in 1941, drawing the U.S. fully into the conflict. The attack marked a turning point, and the U.S. allied with Britain and the Soviet Union, creating a formidable coalition against the Axis powers.  
        The war was marked by unprecedented brutality and destruction, with major battles fought on land, sea, and air. Innovations in military technology, including tanks, aircraft, and atomic bombs, escalated the devastation. The Eastern Front, where the Soviet Union repelled Germany, was one of the war's deadliest theaters, costing millions of lives. Meanwhile, the Holocaust, Hitler's systematic extermination of Jews and other groups, represented one of history's darkest atrocities, with an estimated six million Jews murdered in concentration camps and ghettos. Civilians across Europe and Asia experienced unimaginable suffering, with cities bombed, economies crippled, and communities torn apart.  
        The tide began to turn in favor of the Allies after key victories, such as the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943 and the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944. By 1945, the Allies closed in on Germany from both the eastern and western fronts, leading to Hitler's suicide and Germany's surrender on May 7, 1945. In the Pacific, the war continued until August 1945, when the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, prompting Japan's surrender and bringing the conflict to an end. 
        World War II fundamentally reshaped the world, leading to the establishment of the United Nations and the onset of the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The war’s devastation underscored the need for international cooperation and new frameworks to prevent future conflicts. As nations rebuilt, the lessons of World War II profoundly impacted politics, human rights policies, and international relations, shaping the modern era.</p>
